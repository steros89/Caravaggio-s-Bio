                        Early Years
                    </h3>

                    <p class="normaltext">
                        Caravaggio, whose fiery masterpieces included "The Death of the Virgin" and "David with the Head
                        of
                        Goliath," and who inspired generations of artists, was born as Michelangelo Merisi da Caravaggio
                        in
                        1571
                        in Italy. The world he arrived in was violent and, at times, unstable. His birth came just a
                        week
                        before
                        the Battle of Lepanto, a bloody conflict in which Turkish invaders were driven out of
                        Christendom.

                        Not much is known about Caravaggio's early family life. His father, Fermo Merisi, was the
                        steward
                        and
                        architect of the marquis of Caravaggio. When Caravaggio was six, the bubonic plague rolled
                        through
                        his
                        life, killing almost everyone in his family, including his father.

                        According to writer Andrew Graham-Dixon, author of the 2011 biography "Caravaggio: A Life Sacred
                        and
                        Profane," the artist's troubled adult years stemmed directly from that traumatic loss of his
                        family.
                        "He
                        almost seems bound to transgress," Dixon writes. "It's almost like he cannot avoid
                        transgressing. As
                        soon as he's welcomed by authority, welcomed by the pope, welcomed by the Knights of Malta, he
                        has
                        to do
                        something to screw it up. It's almost like a fatal flaw."

                        Orphaned, Caravaggio took to the streets and fell in with a group of "painters and swordsmen who
                        lived
                        by the motto nec spe, nec metu, 'without hope, without fear,'" wrote an earlier biographer.

                        At the age of 11, Caravaggio relocated to Milan and began apprenticing with the painter Simone
                        Peterzano. In his late teens, perhaps as early as 1588, a penniless Caravaggio moved to Rome.
                        There,
                        to
                        keep himself fed, Caravaggio found work assisting other painters, many of them far less talented
                        than
                        he. But as instability defined his existence, Caravaggio jumped from one job to the next.

                        Sometime around 1595, Caravaggio struck out on his own and started selling his paintings through
                        a
                        dealer. His work soon caught the attention of Cardinal Francesco del Monte, who adored
                        Caravaggio's
                        paintings and quickly set him up in his own house, with room, board and a pension.

                        A prolific painter, Caravaggio was known to work quickly, often starting and completing a
                        painting
                        in
                        just two weeks. By the time he had come under the influence of del Monte, Caravaggio already had
                        40
                        works to his name. The lineup included "Boy with a Basket of Fruit," "The Young Bacchus" and
                        "The
                        Music
                        Party."

                        Much of Caravaggio's early work featured chubby, pretty young boys done up as angels or
                        lutenists or
                        his
                        favorite saint, John the Baptist. Many of the boys in the paintings are naked or loosely
                        clothed.
                        Caravaggio's only known assistant was a boy named Cecco, who appears in a number of Caravaggio's
                        works
                        and who may have also been his lover.

                        Widening Appeal
                    </h3>
                    <p class="normaltext">
                        In 1597, Caravaggio was awarded the commission for the decoration of the Contarelli Chapel in
                        the
                        Church
                        of San Luigi dei Francesi in Rome. It was an important and daunting assignment, charging the
                        26-year-old
                        painter with the task of creating three large paintings depicting separate scenes from St.
                        Matthew's
                        life.

                        The three resulting works, "St. Matthew and the Angel," "The Calling of St. Matthew," and "The
                        Martyrdom
                        of St. Matthew," were finished in 1601, and together showed Caravaggio's remarkable range as an
                        artist.

                        But these works also provoked much consternation from the church and public alike. In his
                        execution
                        of
                        the work, Caravaggio eschewed the traditional worshipful depictions of the saints and presented
                        St.
                        Matthew in a far more realistic light. His first version of "St. Matthew and the Angel" caused
                        so
                        much
                        angst among his patrons that he had to redo it.

                        For Caravaggio, however, the commission provided an exciting new direction for his painting, one
                        in
                        which he could lift traditional religious scenes and cast them with his own dark interpretation.
                        His
                        biblical scenes became populated with the prostitutes, beggars and thieves whom he had
                        encountered
                        on
                        the streets of Rome.

                        In addition to some financial relief, the Contarelli Chapel commission also provided Caravaggio
                        a
                        wealth
                        of exposure and work. His paintings from the next few years included "The Crucifixion of St.
                        Peter,"
                        "The Conversion of St. Paul," "The Deposition of Christ" and his famous "Death of the Virgin."
                        The
                        latter, with its depiction of the Virgin Mary with a swollen belly and bared legs, packed so
                        much of
                        Caravaggio's style that it was turned away by the Carmelites and eventually landed in the hands
                        of
                        the
                        Duke of Mantua.

                    <h3 class="titlesparagraph">Troubled Life</h3>
                    <p class="normaltext">
                        Controversy, though, only fueled Caravaggio's success. And as that success grew, so did the
                        painter's
                        own personal turmoil. He could be a violent man, with drastic mood swings and a love for
                        drinking
                        and
                        gambling.

                        A frequent fighter, Caravaggio eventually served a short prison sentence in 1603 following
                        another
                        painter's complaint that Caravaggio had attacked him. But the next few years only saw
                        Caravaggio's
                        temper becoming hotter. His litany of assaults included throwing a plate of artichokes at a
                        waiter
                        in
                        1604, and attacking Roman guards with stones in 1605. Wrote one observer: "After a fortnight's
                        work
                        he
                        will swagger about for a month or two with a sword at his side and a servant following him, from
                        one
                        ballcourt to the next, ever ready to engage in a fight or an argument."

                        His violence finally erupted with force in 1606, when he killed a well-known Roman pimp named
                        Ranuccio
                        Tomassoni. Historians have long speculated about what was at the root of the crime. Some have
                        suggested
                        that it was over an unpaid debt, while others have claimed that it was the result of an argument
                        over a
                        game of tennis. More recently, historians, including Andrew Graham-Dixon, have pointed to
                        Caravaggio's
                        lust for Tomassoni's wife, Lavinia.</p>

                    <h3 class="titlesparagraph">On the run</h3>
                    <p class="normaltext">
                        Immediately following the murder, Caravaggio fled Rome and sought refuge in a host of other
                        locations:
                        Naples, Malta and Sicily, among others. But even as he fled from punishment for his crime, fame
                        followed
                        Caravaggio. In Malta, he was received into the Order of Malta as a Knight of Justice, an award
                        that
                        he
                        was soon stripped of when the Order learned of the crime he had committed.

                        However, even as he fled, Caravaggio continued to work. In Naples, he painted "Madonna of the
                        Rosary"
                        for a fellow painter, and later "The Seven Works of Mercy" for the church of Pio Chapel of Monte
                        della
                        Misericordia.

                        In Malta, he created "Beheading of St. John the Baptist" for the cathedral in Valletta. In
                        Messina,
                        his
                        work included "The Resurrection of Lazarus" and "The Adoration of the Shepherds," while in
                        Palermo
                        he
                        painted the "Adoration with St. Francis and St. Lawrence."

                        One of Caravaggio's more shocking paintings from this period is "Resurrection," in which the
                        painter
                        revealed a less saintly, more bedraggled Jesus Christ escaping from his tomb in the middle of
                        the
                        night.
                        This scene was no doubt inspired by events in Caravaggio's own life. By this time, Caravaggio
                        had
                        become
                        a nervous wreck, always on the run and in constant fear for his life, so much so that he slept
                        with
                        his
                        clothes on and with a dagger at his side.</p>

                    <h3 class="titlesparagraph">Later Years</h3>
                    <p class="normaltext">
                        The murder that Caravaggio committed in 1606 was not the end of his violence. In July 1608, he
                        attacked
                        Fra Giovanni Rodomonte Roero, one of the most senior knights in the Order of St. John in Malta.
                        Caravaggio was arrested and jailed for the assault but managed to escape just one month later.

                        According to Andrew Graham-Dixon's research, Roero did not put the attack behind him. In 1609,
                        he
                        followed Caravaggio to Naples and assaulted the painter outside a tavern, disfiguring his face.

                        The attack had a profound impact on Caravaggio's mental and physical state. His vision and
                        brushwork
                        suffered from the assault, as evidenced by two of his later paintings, "The Martyrdom of Saint
                        Ursula"
                        and "The Denial of Saint Peter."

                        In order to avoid punishment for murder, Caravaggio's only salvation could come from the pope,
                        who
                        had
                        the power to pardon him. Most likely informed that friends were working on his behalf to secure
                        his
                        pardon, in 1610, Caravaggio began to make his way back to Rome. Sailing from Naples, he was
                        arrested
                        in
                        Palo, where his boat had made a stop. Upon his release, he resumed his journey and eventually
                        arrived at
                        Port'Ercole, where he died just a few days later, on July 18, 1610.

                        For many years the exact cause of Caravaggio's death had been shrouded in mystery. But in 2010,
                        a
                        team
                        of scientists who studied Caravaggio's remains discovered that his bones contained high levels
                        of
                        lead—levels high enough, they suspect, to have driven the painter mad. Lead poisoning is also
                        suspected
                        of having killed Francisco Goya.

                        Influence
                        Even though Caravaggio was shunned after his death, he eventually came to be recognized as one
                        of
                        the
                        founding fathers of modern painting. His work greatly influenced so many future masters, from
                        Diego
                        Velazquez to Rembrandt. In Rome, in 2010, an exhibition of his work that marked the 400th
                        anniversary of
                        his death attracted more than 580,000 visitors.</p>
