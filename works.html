                        The Calling of Saint Matthew</h3>
                    <p class="normaltext">
                        This masterpiece by Caravaggio shows the very moment in which Jesus inspired Matthew to follow
                        him. Standing alongside Saint Peter, Jesus points at Matthew, who is sitting at a table with
                        four other men. It is evident that Caravaggio was inspired by the real world in most of his art
                        and this work is no exception, as he anchors the biblical scene in a modern reality. It is also
                        possible that he was influenced by Michelangelo’s Sistine Chapel painting of God, pointing
                        directly towards Adam to awaken him.

                        Bacchus
                    </h3>

                    <p class="normaltext"> Bacchus was the Roman name for Dionysus, the Greek god of wine, madness and
                        ecstasy. Here, he is,
                        somewhat appropriately, portrayed by Caravaggio as a 17th century Italian teenager. The painting
                        is
                        interesting for a number of reasons: Many have speculated that Caravaggio used a mirror to
                        paint,
                        modelling himself posing as Bacchus (note that the wine is held in the figure’s left hand).
                        What’s
                        more,
                        upon restoration of the work, a tiny reflection of Caravaggio, paintbrush in hand, was also
                        discovered
                        on the wine carafe!

                        The Fortune Teller</h3>
                    <p class="normaltext">
                        Unlike most Italian art of the time, ‘The Fortune Teller’ does not portray a story from the
                        Bible or
                        Greco-Roman mythology. It is simply a scene from everyday life, which was popular in the
                        paintings
                        of northern Europe, not Italy. Caravaggio’s work shows a wealthy young man who naively trusts a
                        gypsy girl to read his palm. He stares into her eyes as she gently slips a ring off his finger!
                        The
                        work is an example of the artist’s penchant for drawing his inspiration from nature and everyday
                        events, rather than from the works of the hallowed artistic masters of the past.

                    <p class="normaltext">
                        Hailed as “one of the most important works in Western painting” by author Andrea Pomella, this
                        masterpiece was the largest altarpiece ever painted by Caravaggio. The canvas is so large that
                        the
                        figures are approximately life-sized, hanging dominantly in St. John’s Co-Cathedral in Malta,
                        the
                        church for which it was originally commissioned. The oil depicts the execution of John the
                        Baptist
                        and is the only work that Caravaggio ever signed. His signature, located in the blood that
                        spills
                        from John’s throat, was discovered during restoration of the work.

                        Judith Beheading Holofernes</h3>
                    <p class="normaltext">
                        Judith Beheading Holofernes’ represents the first time Caravaggio chose to depict such a
                        dramatic
                        subject. He captured the moment of decapitation with dramatic flair by using lighting from the
                        side
                        against an inky, black background. The realism of the scene is undeniable, marked especially by
                        the
                        facial expressions of the figures. Holofernes contorts his body and screams, while Judith’s
                        expression reveals a mix of determination and repulsion. In fact, the realism of the painting
                        has
                        led some to believe that Caravaggio was influenced by the highly publicized execution of
                        Beatrice
                        Cenci in Rome in 1599.

                    <p class="normaltext">
                        For the sake of consistency – if not pleasantry – we continue here with the beheading theme and
                        take
                        a look at Caravaggio’s ‘David with the Head of Goliath’. Another extremely dramatic and
                        theatrical
                        work, David is depicted not celebrating his victory over the giant, but rather lost in thought,
                        perhaps pondering his curious biblical connection and bond with his adversary. Another
                        thought-provoking aspect is the fact that Caravaggio painted himself as Goliath. He had painted
                        another version on the same theme just a few years earlier; this one, however, is much darker,
                        shadier and more visceral in its representations.

                        Basket of Fruit</h3>
                    <p class="normaltext">
                        Caravaggio helped make the still-life a popular artistic genre. The late 16th-century painting
                        ‘Basket of Fruit’ is an example of the sheer effort and design that went into all his works. The
                        basket sits at eye level and juts out over the edge of the table, threatening to fall right into
                        the
                        viewer’s lap. Critics have long debated the meaning behind the worm-eaten, overly ripe fruit;
                        it’s
                        even possible that Caravaggio simply painted what was available at the time.

                    <p class="normaltext">
                        This painting, completed around 1602 and depicting the arrest of Jesus Christ, is today located
                        in
                        the National Gallery of Ireland in Dublin. Aside from Caravaggio’s mastery of the lighting,
                        color
                        and shade, the story of the painting’s disappearance and recent discovery are notable.
                        Considered
                        lost by the late 18th-century, the painting’s whereabouts were unknown until 1990, when it was
                        recognized in the residence of the Society of Jesus in Dublin. Complicating things was the fact
                        that
                        there are at least 12 known copies of ‘The Taking of Christ’ in all!

                    <p class="normaltext">
                        Caravaggio painted two versions of Medusa – this being the second version that is currently held
                        in
                        the Uffizi Gallery in Florence. The work is truly unique – it is painted on a ceremonial shield
                        that
                        was presented to Ferdinand I de’ Medici, who was the Duke of Tuscany at the time. The concave
                        surface of the shield must have presented Caravaggio with a perspective challenge – one that he
                        successfully navigated by the looks of things!
