                            September
                            1571 - Porto
                            Ercole,
                            18
                            July
                            1610)</i> was an
                        Italian artist active in Rome, Naples, Malta and Sicily between 1593 and 1610. He is commonly
                        placed
                        in the Baroque school, of which he is considered the first great representative.

                        Even in his own lifetime Caravaggio was considered enigmatic, fascinating, rebellious and
                        dangerous.
                        He burst upon the Rome art scene in 1600, and thereafter never lacked for commissions or
                        patrons,
                        yet he handled his success atrociously. An early published notice on him, dating from 1604 and
                        describing his lifestyle some three years previously, tells how "after a fortnight's work he
                        will
                        swagger about for a month or two with a sword at his side and a servant following him, from one
                        ball-court to the next, ever ready to engage in a fight or an argument, so that it is most
                        awkward
                        to get along with him." In 1606 he killed a young man in a brawl and fled from Rome with a price
                        on
                        his head. In Malta in 1608 he was involved in another brawl, and yet another in Naples in 1609,
                        possibly a deliberate attempt on his life by unidentified enemies. By the next year, after a
                        relatively brief career, he was dead.</p>
